Class Log - 1st August 2025 --- Friday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- Revision of Functions

Brief Description
------------------
Reviewed all three types of functions in C#:
1. Parameter-less functions
2. Parameterized functions
3. Return-type functions

Students refreshed their understanding of how functions help in modularizing code and improving logic reusability.

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- User credentials check
- Reversal of a number
- Word vowel check

Homework
---------
- Revise all function types and their syntax

Class Log - 5th August 2025 --- Tuesday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#
- Static Storage Class
- Access Modifiers: default, private, public
- Creating Instance using `new` keyword
- Difference between External and Internal Classes

Brief Description
------------------
Started Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#, a powerful programming paradigm that allows data and behavior to be bundled into objects.

Covered:
- **What is OOP?** Expained the need of OOP and how was it introduced
- **Static Storage Class**: Explained how static members work.
- **Access Modifiers**: Compared `default`, `private`, and `public`, and how they control visibility/scope.
- **Creating Objects**: Demonstrated using `new` keyword to create instances.
- **Internal vs External Class**: Explained the concept of defining classes inside/outside a namespace/file and their access implications.

This session was crucial for laying the foundation of real-world coding practices using classes and objects.

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- Created basic class with a method/function
- Demonstrated static vs instance behavior
- Practiced public and private access modifier use
- Discussed external class and it's use-case

Homework
---------
- Revise the concepts of OOP discussed today and make notes
