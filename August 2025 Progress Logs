Class Log - 1st August 2025 --- Friday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- Revision of Functions

Brief Description
------------------
Reviewed all three types of functions in C#:
1. Parameter-less functions
2. Parameterized functions
3. Return-type functions

Students refreshed their understanding of how functions help in modularizing code and improving logic reusability.

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- User credentials check
- Reversal of a number
- Word vowel check

Homework
---------
- Revise all function types and their syntax

Class Log - 5th August 2025 --- Tuesday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#
- Static Storage Class
- Access Modifiers: default, private, public
- Creating Instance using `new` keyword
- Difference between External and Internal Classes

Brief Description
------------------
Started Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#, a powerful programming paradigm that allows data and behavior to be bundled into objects.

Covered:
- **What is OOP?** Expained the need of OOP and how was it introduced
- **Static Storage Class**: Explained how static members work.
- **Access Modifiers**: Compared `default`, `private`, and `public`, and how they control visibility/scope.
- **Creating Objects**: Demonstrated using `new` keyword to create instances.
- **Internal vs External Class**: Explained the concept of defining classes inside/outside a namespace/file and their access implications.

This session was crucial for laying the foundation of real-world coding practices using classes and objects.

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- Created basic class with a method/function
- Demonstrated static vs instance behavior
- Practiced public and private access modifier use
- Discussed external class and it's use-case

Homework
---------
- Revise the concepts of OOP discussed today and make notes

Topics Covered
--------------
- Revised the concepts discussed in last class that is about OOPs concepts again. 

Brief Description
------------------
- Just revised about the concepts of OOPs like classes, objects etc again.

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- Question done on "Book shop simulation" where we have to simulate a book shop. A customer can view, borrow and return books.

Homework

Class Log - 8th August 2025 --- Friday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- Data Encapsulation. 

Brief Description
------------------
- Studied the first pillar of Object Oriented Programming, i.e., "Data Encapsulation". It is a process of encapsulating/bundling properties and methods in a 
class and also, protecting the data from unauthorized access. We make variables private and then to make them accesible outside the class, we make the setter 
and getter functions. Also studied the concept of "This". This is a keyword known as "Access modifier" which is used to access the variables defined globally
in the class. We use it as a convention to differentiate between the names of function variables and class variables. But there is more concepts about "this"
keyword.
So, setters and getters are functions to set and get the values of the private class variables outside the class where it's instance is made.

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- Normal basic questions on classes like student details simulation etc.

Homework
---------
- Revise the concepts of setters and getters (accessors and mutators).
