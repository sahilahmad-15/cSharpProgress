Class Log - 23rd July 2025 --- Wednesday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- while loop – Introduction
- do-while loop – Introduction
- Git – Introduction & Hands-on

Brief Description
------------------
Introduced two fundamental types of loops in programming: `while` (entry-controlled) and `do-while` (exit-controlled). Also introduced Git and version control to track code changes and collaborate using GitHub.

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- Printing numbers 1 to 10 using while loop and do-while loop
- Summation of n terms using while loop
- Git basics: initializing repo, adding files, committing, pushing to GitHub

Homework
---------
- Write programs using while and do-while loops for:
  - Checking range of even/odd numbers
  - Checking prime or composite numbers (single and range)
  - Table of a number
  - Fibonacci series
  - Summation of n terms
  - Factorial of n
- Initialize Git repository in Visual Studio and push all programs to GitHub
