Class Log - 23rd July 2025 --- Wednesday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- while loop – Introduction
- do-while loop – Introduction
- Git – Introduction & Hands-on

Brief Description
------------------

1. while loop:
   - Entry-controlled loop used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
   - Syntax:
     while(condition) {
         // code block
     }

2. do-while loop:
   - Exit-controlled loop that executes at least once regardless of condition.
   - Syntax:
     do {
         // code block
     } while(condition);

3. Git Introduction:
   - Basic understanding of version control.
   - Topics discussed:
     - What is Git?
     - Git vs GitHub
     - Repository creation and local commit

Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- Printing numbers 1 to 10 using while loop and do while loop

- Basics of Git and Github (like pushing repository to Github and Collaborating repositories)

Homework
---------
- Write a program to check range of even/odd numbers using while and do while loop.
- Write a program to check if a number is prime or composite using while and do while loop.

===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
- Functions in C#.
- Basics of functions in C#.


Brief Description
------------------
- Learned what is functions, what problems does a function solve and how do we create them.
-> A function is a reusable block of called that can perform any assigned task whenever it's called. It helps is code  resuibility, code management and logic division.


Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
- Made a function of even/odd and positive negative.


Homework
---------
- Do all the 7 problems solved in loops (like range of prime, range of even odd, fibonacci etc) in terms of functions.


Students Present

- Shaiaan.
- Shanib.
- Sahil.
- Faizan.

Class Log - 29th July 2025 --- Tuesday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
Types of functions in C#.
Learned the basics or first 2 types of functions.

Brief Description
------------------
There are primarily 3 types of functions.
1. Parameter-less functions.
2. Parameterized functions.
3. Return type functions.


Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
Addition with and without parameter.
Printing table with and without parameter.
Summation with and without parameter.


Homework
---------
Do all the 6 given loop problems using parameterized and non parameter functions.

===========================
Class Log - 30th July 2025 --- Wednesday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
Did some more problem sets on parameterized and non-parameterized functions.


Brief Description
------------------
No new topic discussed, only did more questions.


Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
isPrime, isFactorial, oddEven, User credentials check etc.

Class Log - 31st July 2025 --- Thursday
===========================

Topics Covered
--------------
Return type function.


Brief Description
------------------
Today, we studied a third type of function, that is return type functions; Return type functions are those types of functions that return us some value at the
end of the function execution. THis can be any value, like a bool, char, string, float, int.


Examples Solved in Class
-------------------------
isPrime, isFactorial, oddEven, User credentials check etc.


Homework
---------
Complete the user credential program at home.
